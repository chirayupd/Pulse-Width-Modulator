# Pulse-Width-Modulator

In Power Electronics, Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is the core for control and has proven effective in driving modern semiconductor power devices. Majority of power electronic circuits are controlled by PWM signals of various forms. Pulse Width Modulation is effective and commonly used as control technique to generate analog signals from a digital device like a microcontroller. This report will discuss Pulse Width Modulation, various types of modulation techniques, signal generation, its applications, advantages and disadvantages.
